Requirements
------------

- the Boost library is used for various tasks, so install 
	libboost-dev and possibly libboost-thread-dev and libboost-system-dev
- GLUT and openGL (we use freeGLUT)
	freeglut3-dev 
	
Compile
-------

'make' in the base directory should do the job

'make clean' is also available

As it is now, it will NOT work if you try to execute 'make' directly in a subdirectory. The makefiles in the subdirectories rely upon parameters sent by the base makefile.
Even if you modified only your own application's source, compile it by running 'make' at the simulator's base directory

The applications binaries will appear in subdirectories of applicationsBin

Note that the makefile always computes the correct dependencies, even upon modified headers (.h) files. 
A "make clean" is thus only necessary if you changed compile options in the makefile itself.
