To enable meld development, especially on the blinkyblocks, we are
developing a debugger which will help debug the system, both under
simulation and on the real hardware.  This is an initial spec for the
simulator version.

Commands we would like to support:

<block>: a block id
<range>: <block>-<block>
<fact>: the name of a fact

Dump [<block>|<range>] [<fact>]
     dump the state of the system
     if <block> is specified, limit it to the specified block or range of blocks
     if <fact> is specified, limit it to a particular fact

breakpoint [<block>] [<fact>] [<action>] [<sense>]
     stop execution when 
     + <fact>: <fact> is proven
     + -<fact>: when <fact> is retracted (or deleted if linear)
     + <action>: an action is taken.  Action can be sendmsg, setcolor
     + <sense>: a sense fact is instantied, e.g., tap, getmsg, neighbor

continue [<block>]
     continue execution of system or a particular block
